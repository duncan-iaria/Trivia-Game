#Trivia Game
_built in angularjs_

##Why AngularJS?
Mostly because I have a work assignment that needs to be built with it so I need to figure it out as quickly as I can.
Would I use AngularJS in a real-world scenario in which I had to make this game? Not - probably not. It is indeed overkill.
However, like I said - I need to get familiar with it, so since it's still written in JS - I figured, "why not?"
