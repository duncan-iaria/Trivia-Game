# Trivia Game
_built in angularjs_

## Goals
1. Learn AngularJS
2. Use GitHub appropriately with multiple branches
3. Use JSON for data

### Why AngularJS?
Mostly because I have a work assignment that needs to be built with it so I need to figure it out as quickly as I can.
Would I use AngularJS in a real-world scenario in which I had to make this game? No - probably not. It is indeed overkill.
However, like I said - I need to get familiar with it, so since it's still written in JS - I figured, "why not?"

### Use GitHub Right
I'm going to attempt to use GitHub as intended, with multiple branches that flow into each other. Once again - probably overkill for
a single developer working on a 3-4 day homework assignment, but might as well practice now before having to manage a project with
multiple developers at the same time.

### Use JSON for Data
I'd like to get comfortable using JSON for data storage and transfer. Putting the trivia data in a JSON file will give me a chance
to practice, and will also allow for editing the trivia questions without requiring someone to open any of the game logic files.
